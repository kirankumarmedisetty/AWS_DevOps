Q. Why Configuration Management came into existence?
Ans: Earlier for eg. upgrading, patching, installations we used to depend on shell/powershell scpting based on servers 
and based on distribution like for eg. Centos, Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora we have to change the scipt. It used to become tedious
task when there are huge number of servers. To overcome this problem Configuration Managment tool like Ansible came into existence.
